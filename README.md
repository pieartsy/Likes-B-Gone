# Likes-B-Gone
A hacky component for Discourse to get rid of the ability to see likes. Currently I have not figured out how to turn off a user's ability to see others' likes yet still like things themself. F. Working on it.

1. Go to the the theme area of your admin console. Something like this: `your.site.com/admin/customize/themes`

2. Click "Install"

3. Click "From a git repository" and put this into the box: `https://github.com/pieartsy/Likes-B-Gone.git`

This adds the component to your Discourse so you can apply it to a theme.

4. After importing the component, go to the theme* you want to add it to and look for the "Included Components" section. Then add "Likes-B-Gone".

*NOTE: If you do not want to add this component to an existing theme, feel free to do step 3 with this theme which I like `https://github.com/discourse/discourse-theme-hibiscus.git` (just put the url in the same box as indicated in step 3, and use that theme for step 4). You can name it Likes-B-Gone Hibiscus or something.

If it breaks, then it will only break for the people who have this theme installed (me) and it will be entirely my fault!
